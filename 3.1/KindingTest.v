(* Dan says, pg 65, we cannot derive \Delta, \alpha : A |-k- \alpha : \Kappa we we
   can derive \Delta, \alpha : A |-k- \alpha *: B.  

   Let's prove this as I'm worried that he means Figure 3.6 
        \Delta |-k- \tau : B -> \Delta |-k- tau : A 
   is only to be applied to concrete types. 

  Or does he have a K for AK ?

Example alpha_star_B :
    K (D.ctxt (TV.var 0) A ddot) (ptype (tv_t (TV.var 0))) B.
Proof.
  apply K_star_A.

(* Which invalidates the return progress theorem unless it's type is
  restricted. This explains a lot. *)
