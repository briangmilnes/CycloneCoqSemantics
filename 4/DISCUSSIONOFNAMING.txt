 I need to rethink the naming of my subst/open/close/lc/body
fixpoints and the lemmas. As well as my selection of his
lemmas.

I don't need to work with his alternative defintions of
LC/Body and those theorems.

I do need his close theorems for implementing pack I think,
unlike the STLC.

The STLC set of theorems seems the best + the close theorems
from the Jar paper.

In Cyclone I have three types of substitution
tau for tau in tau
tau for tau in term
var for var in term

and two specializations:
tau for tvar in tau
tau for tvar in term.

Possible Notation:
 t  - type
 tv - type variable
 t  - v term variable
 tm - term
 __ - implies
 _iff_ 

 ttvt
 tttm
 vvtm
 ttvt
 ttvtm

 [>] for a substitution

 [t ttvt> alpha]t'
 [t tttm> alpha]tm
 [x vvtm> y]tm
 [t ttvt> alpha]t'
 [t ttvtm> alpha]tm

FV
 ftvt
 fvtm_{v,st,e,f}
 fvtm
 ftvtm_{v,st,e,f}
 ftvtm
 fv_CONTEXT
 ftv_CONTEXT

Plus rec/blank
 {>} for an open
 {<} for a close

Open
 open_t
 open_ttm
 open_tm
And so on.
"t ^^ttvt.. u" := (open t u) (at level 67).
"t ^ x" := (open t (trm_fvar x)).

Close
 close_t
 close_ttm
 close_tm 

body_t  - body type
body_tm - body term

LC
 lc_t
 lc_ttm
 lc_tm

Lemmas:
 useless_open
 lc_X__subst_identity
 subst_X_fresh
 subst_X_dist_open_X
 subst_X_open_var_X_commutes
 subst_intro
 subst_preserves_lc
 lc_dfun__body  - ?
 body__lc_dfun  - ?
 body_lc__lc_open  
 typing__ok_and_lc
 value__lc
 fresh__close_open_identity
 open_injective
 open_close_var_on_open_var
 lc__open_close_identity
 close_var_inj
 lc_defun_iff_body
 fv_open
 open_var_fv
 close_var_fv

and more from the Lambda paper.
