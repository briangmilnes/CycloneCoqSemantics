 This is the definition of formal syntax for Dan Grossman's Thesis, 
  "SAFE PROGRAMMING AT THE C LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION". 

   TODO think about functions vs relations for get proofs, getU at least needs these.

   TODO bugs in the test code for pack.

   TODO learn the proof general options.

   TODO Check that I have the tightest quantifiers in theorems
      as this was required in Return Preservation.

   TODO kinding is wrong, either dan mean \tau for concrete type or 
       there is an implementation or thesis bug.

   TODO 
        a) Added the checks I missed from the rules to make
           \Delta, \Gamma, \Upsilon have not collisions. - Done
	b) Add WFD as it is not checked anywhere, just ensured in its construction.
	c) What lemmas do I want ? The proofs will really tell.



   TODO Think about alpha conversion.

   TODO  https://github.com/wilcoxjay/tactics

   TODO learn pose.

   TODO Should I add syntactic sugar?

   TODO get dan to answer questions.

   TODO prove everything.

   TODO think about how I should actually prove things in Coq? What's
    for free.
