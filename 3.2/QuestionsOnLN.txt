All of the unanswered questions on LN/TLC.

Experiements

1) env_ind, is that why environment induction is working?
Try his style environment induction in milnes style.

2) Suss out the standard finite sets for use in variables.

3) Do I need his rightward style in environments?


Pros
1) Lots of automation.
2) Too many changes to understand or make it simple for people to
 pick up.


Cons
1) Uses lists.
2) Lots of rewriting, but that happens with my style too.
3) bad theorem naming
4) syntax really only works if you have a single term to iterate
through, can be fixed.
5) 

Milnes Style

Cons
1) I'm not using standard relations models for my equalities,
 I should be using Coq.Bool.BoolEq. 
2) I also have lots of unfolding.
3) Not enough automation.
4) I'm writing ML style modules instead of typeclass shortcuts.
4) I should be using WSet of variables. 

Pro
1) Lib LN is only 230 lines. Sucking up 25KLOC of TLC seems insane
 for this value.
